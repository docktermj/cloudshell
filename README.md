# Cloudshell

Forked from
[github.com/zephinzer/cloudshell](https://github.com/zephinzer/cloudshell).

The purpose of this fork is to adjust the invocation structure to be more in line with
[cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and
[viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
such that they can easily be incorporated into larger projects.

The following are the major additions:

- `cmd/root.go`
- `xtermserver/`
- `xtermservice/`
